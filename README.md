# angular-springboot
Basically, I have created two projects:
1.springboot-backend: This project is used to develop CRUD RESTFul APIs for a simple Employee Management System using Spring Boot, JPA, and MySQL as a database.
2.angular-frontend: This project is used to develop single page application using Angular 12 as front-end technology. This Angular application consumes CRUD Restful APIs developed and exposed by a springboot-backend project.
